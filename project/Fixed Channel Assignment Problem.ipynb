    "### <span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'> The memetic algorithm and civilization simulation approaches provided good accuracy due to their ability to generate and evaluate multiple offspring in each generation.

    "## <span style='font-family:\"Times New Roman\"'> In conclusion, the choice between the memetic algorithm, civilization simulation, and SA depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If accuracy is paramount, the memetic algorithm or civilization simulation can be suitable. If speed is the priority, the SA algorithm offers a more efficient solution. For a balance between accuracy and speed, the civilization simulation approach can be considered.\n",
